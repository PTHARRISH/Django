# A relational database is a type of database that organizes data into tables, 
# which are composed of rows and columns. 
# Each row represents a record of data, and each column represents a field or attribute of data. 
# Tables can be linked together by common fields, called keys, to show the relationships between data. 
# Users can query the database using SQL, a language for manipulating and retrieving data
