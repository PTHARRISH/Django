# Creating the first Apps in Django
# To create your first Django project using the terminal and the VS Code editor. 
# You will also learn how to set up the development environment, by installing a virtual environment,

# virtual environment: 
# Some common CLI commands used to create Django projects and launched the development server.
# If you are a Python developer working on multiple projects, 
# It's best practice to keep your projects isolated in a virtual environment, 
# which you may be wondering why you need to do this. 
# Django projects can often be quite large and involve specific dependencies for things like packages. 
# For example you could have a package that has a dependency on a specific version.
# You do not want this conflicting with your other Python or 
# Django projects so it's best to keep your projects isolated using a virtual development environment. 
# Virtual environments are isolated spaces you create to manage dependencies and the overall project. 
# This allows you to keep features such as the interpreter, libraries and scripts 
# isolated and installed for a specific project. 


# Development Server
# Django also comes with an integrated development server. 
# This means that the application has a request response relationship with a client. 
# Now that you are familiar with the concept of the virtual development environment and development server 
# let's explore the steps involved in creating a Django project. 
# First, you create a project directory. 
# Next, you create a virtual environment for your Django application. 
# Then you create a Django project and finally run the Django development server.
