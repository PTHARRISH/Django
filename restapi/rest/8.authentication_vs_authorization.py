# Authentication versus authorization
# Introduction
# You need to secure your APIs because they provide third-party clients access to your backend data. 
# If you don’t secure your APIs properly, anyone can tamper with the data and access sensitive information. 
# But even if a client is allowed to access the data, you need to control who can do what. 
# This is where authentication and authorization come in. 
# You now know that although they sound similar, they are not the same. 

# difference between authentication and authorization and how you can use it to protect your API endpoints.

# Authentication
# Authentication is the process of verifying the credentials of a user. 
# Logging into websites with a username and password is a typical example of authentication. 
# When the username and password match, the website recognizes the user and sets some cookies in the user’s browser. 
# When the user visits another page on that website, the browser sends those cookies within the HTTP request header. 
# The website recognizes the cookies as well as server-side session data 
# and therefore doesn’t ask for credentials until the user logs out again. 


# how does this work?
# Token-based authentication usually involves two steps in the API Architecture. 
# First, the client identifies itself with a username and password. 
# Then the API server gives it a bearer token. 
# From there, the client includes the bearer token with every API call that it places. 
# The API server verifies it and then allows the client to perform the action or not. 
# This is where authorization comes in, but more on this later.

# If the credentials are not valid, 
# the client will receive a 401 - Unauthorized HTTP status code.

# This is like coming to the office on the first day, 
# submitting all your papers and documents, and then receiving your employee card. 
# After that, only your employee card will be sufficient to get inside. 
# Authentication works just like that!

# The two steps in the API authentication process can be represented by the following two diagrams. 

# Authentication process: Getting an access token
# 


# Authorization
# However, even with your employee card, you will not be able to access all the rooms or spaces in the office. 
# There are some places that are only accessible to a certain group of people who have been given that privilege. 
# Authorization is exactly like that. 
# Authentication lets you in, authorization lets you act. 
# It checks after authentication if the user has the proper privileges to perform some tasks. 
# On the server side, this is typically done by assigning the user to a group or a set of groups. 
# Then, after verifying the token, the code checks if the user belongs to the appropriate group to perform that task. 
# If not, the client will receive a 403 - Forbidden HTTP status code.  

# This extra authorization layer in the API architecture ensures that only people with proper privileges can access and modify data.
# An authorization system in an API project is very important because it prevents data corruption and data breaches. 

# Implementing authorization 
# Privileges are the tasks that an API user performs, and they are the building blocks of an authorization layer. 
# First, as an API developer, you identify the required privileges in your project. 
# For example, for a bookshop, there might be the following types of privileges:

# Browse the books

# Add new books

# Edit books

# Delete books

# Place orders 

# There can be many other privileges like this. 
# And not every user will have every privilege. 
# For instance, regular customers are not allowed to add and edit books, even if they are properly authenticated. 
# Only managers are allowed to perform those operations. 

# So, after identifying the privileges, you carefully distribute all these privileges into multiple roles. 
# And then, the authorization check is done in the backend code of each API endpoint that requires a user role check. 
# The developer verifies if the user belongs to the appropriate group or roles, and then makes the decision to allow or deny the action. 

# User groups in Django
# The Django admin panel comes with excellent support for the user group system. 
# If you log into the admin panel, you will find two distinct sections – users and groups.

# From here, you can create groups or roles like Manager, Editor, Customer, Admin and so on and assign privileges to these groups. 
# If you click on the Add button next to the groups, you will be taken to a screen where you can create new groups. 
# The Django admin panel will list all the necessary privileges based on the models in your project. 
# Here is a screen that indicates the available privileges for a bookshop.
